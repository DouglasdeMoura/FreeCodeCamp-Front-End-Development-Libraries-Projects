export const DEFAULT_VALUE = `# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:

Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`javascript
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


You may write math:

When $a ${String.raw`\ne`} 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are

$$ x = {-b ${String.raw`\pm`} ${String.raw`\sqrt{b^2-4ac}`} ${String.raw`\over`} 2a} $$

1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
